            <h1>Hello Union.</h1>
            <h2>My name is Jordan Webb.</h2>
            <p>Unionâ€™s ability to develop creative and innovative products that are formed and re-formed by data-driven results is extremely intriguing to me. I have been in search of a role, and a company, where I can implement my skills as both a designer and developer to create powerful user experiences that have a lasting impact - Union appears to be that place. Creating solutions that help better serve others is something I have always strived to do both personally and professionally, and I believe this can be a great mindset to contribute to your team. While working with Union, I can use my foundational design knowledge to communicate effectively with the creative team and apply their vision to building a website or application that is both efficient and compelling.</p>
            <p>I am excited about the future of development as it transitions more and more into component-based applications, serverless functions and cloud databases. All of these innovations help create products that are fast, clean, and efficient while still telling stories that move users to action. I look forward to speaking with you more about this position. Please find the link below to my portfolio site that displays projects I have enjoyed working on recently.</p>
